# Spring JUnit 5 Testing Support

This project serves as the official prototype for [JUnit 5][] testing support
in the [Spring TestContext Framework][] which will eventually be incorporated
into [Spring Framework][] 5.0 in conjunction with [SPR-13575][].

# Using the `SpringExtension`

Currently, all that's needed to use the _Spring TestContext Framework_ with JUnit 5
is to annotate a JUnit Jupiter based test class with `@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)`
and whatever Spring annotations you need (e.g., `@ContextConfiguration`, `@Transactional`,
`@Sql`, etc.), but make sure you use `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, etc. from the appropriate
`org.junit.jupiter.api` package. See [`SpringExtensionTests`] for an example of this
extension in action, and check out the source code of [`SpringExtension`] if you're
interested in the  implementation details.

## Composing Annotations from Spring & JUnit

Spring has supported [composed annotations] for several years now, and as of JUnit 5
annotations in JUnit can also be used as meta-annotations. We can therefore create
custom annotations that are composed from Spring annotations **and** JUnit 5
annotations. Take a look at [`@SpringJUnitJupiterConfig`] for an example, and check out
[`ComposedSpringExtensionTests`] for an example of `@SpringJUnitJupiterConfig` in action.

This project is released under version 2.0 of the [Apache License][].

# Artifacts

There are currently no downloadable artifacts for this project.
However, if you install in a local Maven repository (see below)
the generated artifact will correspond to the following.

 - **Group ID**: `org.springframework.test`
 - **Artifact ID**: `spring-test-junit5`
 - **Version**: `1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`

# Building from Source

This project uses a [Gradle][]-based build system. In the instructions
below, `./gradlew` is invoked from the root of the project and serves as
a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

- [Git][]
- [JDK 8][JDK8]: update 60 or later
- [JUnit 5][]: JUnit Jupiter `5.0.0-SNAPSHOT` and JUnit Platform `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
- [Spring Framework][]: `4.3.0.RELEASE`

Be sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the `jdk1.8.0` folder
extracted from the JDK download.

## Compile and Test

Build all JARs, distribution ZIP files, and docs:

`./gradlew build`

## Install `spring-test-junit5` in local Maven repository

`./gradlew install`

## Running Tests with Gradle

Executing `gradlew clean test` from the command line should result in output similar to the following.

```
:junitPlatformTest

Test run finished after 1902 ms
[        37 tests found     ]
[         0 tests skipped   ]
[        37 tests started   ]
[         0 tests aborted   ]
[        37 tests successful]
[         0 tests failed    ]
```

## Building and Testing with JDK 9

`spring-test-junit5` can be built with and tested against
[JDK 9 early access builds](https://jdk9.java.net/download/) using
[Gradle 3.0 nightly builds](http://gradle.org/gradle-nightly-build/).

For example, we can use a Gradle 3.0 nighty build as follows.

```
$> gradlew wrapper --gradle-distribution-url=https://services.gradle.org/distributions-snapshots/gradle-3.0-20160615000025+0000-bin.zip
$> gradlew -version
$> gradlew clean test
```

Assuming we have OpenJDK `9-ea+122` installed, the above will result in
output similar to the following.

```
------------------------------------------------------------
Gradle 3.0-20160615000025+0000

[         0 tests aborted   ]
[        37 tests successful]
[         0 tests failed    ]

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

# Running Tests in the IDE

In order to execute the tests within an IDE, simply run [`SpringExtensionTestSuite`] as a JUnit 4 test class.
